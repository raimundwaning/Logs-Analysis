# Logs-Analysis
This python program is my solution for the project LogAnalysis of the FullStack Web Developer Nanodegree @Udacity

## Usage
Just run the program with your python interpreter. You need to be in an environment with the news-database running, which is part of the course and provided by udacity in this nanodegree.
